<p>Nothing beats homemade fresh pizza, and if you want a healthier version the
  veggie pizza is just perfect choice.
</p>
<p>It will take you about 40 min of prep time, and 35 min of baking time to prepare this </p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
  <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
  <li>1 cup warm water</li>
  <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
  <li>1 egg</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
  <li>1 (15 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
  <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
  <li>½ small onion, chopped (Optional)</li>
  <li>1 tablespoon dried oregano</li>
  <li>1 clove garlic, finely chopped</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
  <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
  <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
  <li>1 ¼ cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
  <li>½ cup chopped green bell pepper (Optional)</li>
  <li>½ cup chopped onion (Optional)</li>
  <li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms (Optional)</li>
  <li>¼ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>

</ul>

<h2>Directions for preparation</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Sprinkle yeast over warm water in a small bowl. The water should be no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C). Let stand for 5 minutes until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam.</li>
  <li>Sift flour, sugar, 1 tablespoon oregano, and 1 teaspoon salt into a large bowl. Mix egg and oil into dry ingredients; stir in yeast mixture. When dough has pulled together, turn out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.</li>
  <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (235 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet.</li>
  <li>Cook and stir diced tomatoes, tomato paste, onion, 1 tablespoon oregano, garlic, onion powder, 1 teaspoon salt, and pepper in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook until sauce has thickened, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
  <li>Punch down dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Use a knife to divide dough into two equal pieces--do not tear. Shape dough into rounds and let rest for 10 minutes. Form dough into rectangles, and place onto prepared baking sheet. Spoon tomato sauce over dough. Sprinkle with 1 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese; top with bell pepper, onion, and mushroom. Sprinkle 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese over top.</li>
  <li>Bake in preheated oven until crust is browned and crisp and cheese has melted, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>

</ol>

<p>And that is it. I hope you will enjoy this pizza</p>
